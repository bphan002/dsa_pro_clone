# Linked List Cycle Constraints and Hints

## Constraints
-   `The number of the nodes in the list is in the range [0, 10^4].`
-   `-10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5`
-   `pos is -1 or a valid index in the linked-list.`

## Hint #1:
> There are two ways to solve this problem: using a visited set or using fast and slow pointers.

## Hint #2: 
> Using fast and slow pointers, the linked list has a cycle if the fast and slow pointers ever meet.
