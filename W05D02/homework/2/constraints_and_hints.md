# Insert into a Sorted Circular Linked List Constraints and Hints

## Constraints
-   `The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 5 * 10^4].`
-   `-10^6 <= Node.val, insertVal <= 10^6`

## Hint #1:
> Think about all the different cases where you would insert the node.

## Hint #2: 
> case 1: insertVal between smallest and largest vals
> case 2: insertVal between tail and head
> case 3: all nodes have same val
> case 4: no nodes
