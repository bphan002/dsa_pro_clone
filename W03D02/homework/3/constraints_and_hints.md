#  Reduce Array Size to The Half Constraints and Hints

## Constraints
-   `2 <= arr.length <= 10^5`
-   `arr.length is even.`
-   `1 <= arr[i] <= 10^5`

## Hint #1:
> Count the frequency of each integer in the array.

## Hint #2: 
> Start with an empty set, add to the set the integer with the maximum frequency.

## Hint #3:
> Keep Adding the integer with the max frequency until you remove at least half of the integers.
