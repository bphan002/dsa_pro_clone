## Sample Exercises
In each problem folder, you will find 3 files:

1. `problem.py` - This is the file with your prompt and where you will work off of.
2. `constraints.md` - This will show where the problem is defined. It is good practice to think about constraints before looking at them.
3. `test.py` - Navigating to the terminal and then running `python3 -m unittest test` will run the tests for you.
4. `solution.py` - This file contains a sample solution.
