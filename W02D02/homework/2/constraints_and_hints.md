## Constraints
-   `1 <= tokens.length <= 10^4`
-   `tokens[i] is either an operator: "+", "-", "*", or "/", or an integer in the range [-200, 200].`

## Hint #1
> Each operator applies to the previous two values.

## Hint #2
> What pattern would be useful when dealing with things involving reverse order?
