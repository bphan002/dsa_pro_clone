# Spiral Matrix Constraints and Hints

## Constraints
-   `m == matrix.length`
-   `n == matrix[i].length`
-   `1 <= m, n <= 10`
-   `-100 <= matrix[i][j] <= 100`

## Hint #1
> Sometimes the best way to solve a problem is by simulating it. This is one of those problems!

## Hint #2
> Go from start to end and start moving inwards. It can help to use pointers for first_row, first_column, last_row, and last_column.

## Hint #3
> What should we do if we progress outside our boundaries?
