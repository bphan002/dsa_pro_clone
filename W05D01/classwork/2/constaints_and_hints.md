# Remove Linked List Elements Constraints and Hints

## Constraints
-   `The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 10^4].`
-   `1 <= Node.val <= 50`
-   `0 <= val <= 50`

## Hint #1:
> Traverse linked list and identify when you have found the target value to replace .

## Hint #2: 
> Keep track of your previous node.

## Hint #3:
> A dummy node would be useful to take care of edge cases and also easily create a starting point for the previous node pointer.
